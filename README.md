AI Pipeline with LangChain and Google Generative AI
This project integrates LangChain with Google Generative AI to create an AI pipeline that generates dynamic responses. It demonstrates how to retrieve a Google API key and use it with the Gemini Flash Model for generating outputs.

Key Features:

Securely retrieves the Google API key from the Colab environment.
Configures the Gemini Flash Model with custom parameters.
Uses a prompt template to generate AI-driven outputs.
Provides an example query to generate interesting facts.

Setup Instructions:

Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
!pip install -qU langchain_google_genai

Google API Key:

Ensure the Google API key is stored securely in the Colab environment.

Run the Script:

The script creates a prompt template and configures the Gemini Flash Model.

Example query: "Tell me 5 interesting facts about Babylon."
Output is generated using the LangChain pipeline.
Example Usage:
You can find the full code in the main file. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

-The file retrieves the Google API key and configures the model.
-It creates a prompt template for generating dynamic responses.
-It runs the pipeline with an example query, like "Babylon." (other query can also be used)

Notes:
Modify the question in the example query to generate dynamic responses about other topics.
Adjust temperature and max_tokens to fine-tune the model's output.
